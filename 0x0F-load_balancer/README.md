Tasks
Double the number of webservers :
In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and theyâ€™ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since weâ€™re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Requirements:

Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 0-custom_http_response_header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Ignore SC2154 for shellcheck

If your serverâ€™s hostnames are not properly configured ([STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02.), follow this tutorial.

The Hostname configuration in server:

ssh into server ssh ubuntu@your_web_ip
Edit the Nginx default configuration file: sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
Add the following line inside the server block, just above the closing brace (}): add_header X-Served-By $hostname;
Restart Nginx to apply the configuration: sudo service nginx restart
Repeat saem steps for web-02!ðŸ¥‚

Install your load balancer :
Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Requirements:

Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script
Make sure that your servers are configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02. If not, follow this tutorial.
For your answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements

Make sure that HAProxy is installed in the lb-01 server before running the curl commands in your terminal.

Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet :
Just as in task #0, weâ€™d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.

The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
