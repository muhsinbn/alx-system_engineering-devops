In computing, a signal is a software interrupt delivered to a process or a thread by the operating system. It is a mechanism used to notify a process about events or requests that require its attention or action. Signals are an essential part of inter-process communication and process management in operating systems.

Process Termination: Signals can be used to request the termination of a process gracefully. For example, the SIGTERM signal is commonly used to ask a process to exit cleanly, allowing it to perform any necessary cleanup before shutting down.

Forced Termination: The SIGKILL signal is used to forcefully terminate a process without allowing it to perform any cleanup. This signal is often used when a process becomes unresponsive or needs to be stopped immediately.

Process Synchronization: Signals can be used to synchronize the activities of different processes or threads. For example, the SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals are user-defined signals that can be used for specific synchronization purposes.

Error Handling: Some signals are generated when a process encounters errors or exceptional conditions. For example, the SIGSEGV signal is generated when a process attempts to access an invalid memory address.

Alarm and Timeouts: The SIGALRM signal can be used to set alarms or timers to notify a process after a specified amount of time has passed.

Different operating systems have their own sets of predefined signals, and developers can also create their custom signals for specific needs. Signal handling is an important aspect of writing robust and responsive applications, allowing them to respond to various events and conditions effectively.

What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored
In Unix-like operating systems, there are two signals that cannot be ignored by a process: `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP`. These signals have a fixed behavior that cannot be overridden or handled by the process, ensuring certain critical functionality of the operating system.
