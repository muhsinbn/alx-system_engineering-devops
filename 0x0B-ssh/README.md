# 0x0B-SSH project

The 0x0B-ssh project: is a part of the Holberton School curriculum and is designed to teach students about Secure Shell (SSH) and its various use cases. In this project, students typically learn about the following key concepts and tasks related to SSH:

SSH Configuration: Configuring SSH on local and remote systems, including setting up SSH keys, modifying SSH configuration files, and understanding various SSH client and server settings.

SSH Authentication: Understanding different methods of SSH authentication, such as password-based authentication, public key authentication, and multi-factor authentication. Students may learn how to generate SSH key pairs and use them for secure authentication.

SSH Tunnels and Port Forwarding: Exploring the use of SSH for creating secure tunnels and forwarding ports, allowing secure access to services running on remote servers.

SSH Security Best Practices: Learning about security best practices for SSH, including securing SSH configurations, managing user access, and implementing measures to protect against unauthorized access.

SSH File Transfer: Exploring secure file transfer using tools like SCP (Secure Copy) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) over SSH connections.

SSH Configuration Management: Understanding how to manage SSH configurations across multiple systems, including the use of tools like Ansible for SSH-based configuration management.

Throughout the 0x0B-ssh project, students gain practical experience working with SSH and learn how to leverage its capabilities for secure remote access, administration, and file transfer. The project typically includes hands-on tasks, exercises, and real-world scenarios to reinforce the understanding of SSH concepts and usage.
